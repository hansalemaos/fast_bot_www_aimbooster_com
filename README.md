# Fast bot for www.aimbooster.com
Bot for aimbooster.com - source code - 1000x faster than others (Python+C+numexpr+ctypes)

Inspired by Kian Brose's great tutorial  https://github.com/KianBrose/Image-Recognition-Botting-Tutorial , 
I added some C, ctypes and NumPy/numexpr to make it faster. 
Use **pip install numexpr keyboard fast-ctypes-screenshots mousekey locate-pixelcolor-c**  to install all mpdules
You can find the source code here: https://github.com/hansalemaos/fast_bot_www_aimbooster_com/blob/main/oldc.py
Keep in mind that you might have to adjust __c = 660, 371, 1240, 790__ (the region of interest)
